Hey everyone!

On Thursday I'll be talking about my AngularJS project and how I organize it for Continuously Delivery. Having some understanding of the following will be helpful.

semver - http://semver.org/
git-flow - https://github.com/nvie/gitflowe
grunt  - http://gruntjs.com/
npm - https://www.npmjs.org/
bower - http://bower.io/


These articles have influenced my thinking.

See you soon.
